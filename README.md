# CheckLists
CheckLists App from iOS Apprentice 6th Edition - ABANDONDED AT CHAPTER 16

I created this App by following along with the book, but somehow there's something wrong with the code
at the end of Chapter 16 that I simply can't find.  I'm fairly sure the bug has nothing to do with the
code itself, because I did my best to compare it to the original book.

I think my weakness is more of an issue with the Interface Builder itself.  Somewhere along the line
I either missed a drag and drop of some control, or dragged the wrong item to the wrong place.

For what it's worth, I hate when an IDE requires you to do anything using a graphic interace that
can't be done by writing code by hand.  When you have code, at least you can see where you make a mistake.

If anyone is interested, I created a new repository called CheckListsV2, by using the code provided by
the publisher.

Lastly... I HIGHLY recommend this book.  If you want to learn iOS development using Swift, YOU MUST BUY THIS BOOK!
